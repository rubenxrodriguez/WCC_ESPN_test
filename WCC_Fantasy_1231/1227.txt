first i need to see the effects of updating my points_dictionary with a round(1) button because then it becomes black box.
so maybe i add points for making 3s. 
guards make up 40% of the players. but of the top 100 fantasy scorers, guards make up the top 64%. 
there are twice as many guards averaging 20 FP/G as there are F/C. so maybe i need to up blk and decrease steals. then increase pts but also decrease tov because guards get more.

effectively i want to auto add week 0 to all games in my gamelog 
then in my scraper i want to add the week_num function. 
then in my update_fantasy_stats.py i need to add the week_num function
then i need to rerun update_fantasy_stats 

then upgrade MyTeam page

then upgrade the weekly matchups / standings pages 

then add a WCC Team Stats with a full stat sheet 







right now i have these pages : 1_Draft_board.py        2_Standings.py          3_MyTeam.py             4_FreeAgents.py         5_Game_Logs.py          6_UserTeam_Matchups.py

here are my ideas : 

add a wcc_team rosters page where i can scroll through rosters and easily see player stats 
so sort by team. then sort by fantasy points_sum 

Adjusting fantasy points
I like where its at now. id probably just reduce blocks by 0.5 and steals by 0.5 and increase points by 0.5.
so this introduces half points in fantasy. might be a little annoying but overall not a big deal. 
probably want to see a scatterplot of pts vs fantasypts 

weekly standings vs global standings 
    * weekly standings is literally defined week by week where week 1 is 12-28 to 01-04. should have a multiselect
    * Need a better Title / Divider before User Team Weekly Standings 
    * maybe put all players fantasy stats [table] on its own sheet 

My Team page 
    * add an individual game log tracker 
    * before you display the game log table. show Season averages. PTS/REB/AST/FG%

UserTeam Matchups Page 
    * Understanding of how to do week to week
    * maybe i need to add a new column to fantasy_stats_latest with week number. where we map game dates to week. 
    * everything up to 1227 was week 0 [what we used for the draftboard]
    * then we can do userteam matchups based on week number in fantasy_stats_latest



fix my draftboard page 
    * ADP based on stats through Dec 28. fantasy_stats_2025_12_27.csv 
weekly standings vs global standings 
    * weekly standings is literally defined week by week where week 1 is 12-28 to 01-04. should have a multiselect
    * Need a better Title / Divider before User Team Weekly Standings 
    * maybe put all players fantasy stats [table] on its own sheet
